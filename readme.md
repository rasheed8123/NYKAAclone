This website was build in just Three days which to be honest was a difficult task, but thanks to the team for achieving this .The Truth is That Team Work Is At the Heart Of Great Achievements. We came together for the beginning, progressed together ,And achieved the success.
Daily Status
Everyday we would connect to discuss the tasks every individual may perform and then later we would check the status of the tasks completed to bridge our individual work. As always we believed in Alone We Can Do So Little, Together We Can Do So Much
